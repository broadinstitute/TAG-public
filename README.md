# Translational Analysis Group (TAG) Workflow Repository

This is Translational Analysis Group (TAG) public repository, where we maintain frequently 
used utility workflows for the team. Our goal is to facilitate their use on Terra through 
Dockstore, allowing for easy access and streamlined usage.

**NOTE: this Repo is public, so anything you add to this repo is viewable by anyone.**

## Using the Dockstore Automatically Update Workflows in Terra
Workflows registered in Dockstore can be automatically synced when changes are pushed 
to this repo by adding their information to `.dockstore.yml`. This allows any updates or 
changes made to a workflow in this repo to be immediately reflected in any Terra workspaces 
using that workflow.
