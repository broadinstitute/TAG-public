This modified version of the DownsampleBam workflow focuses on mitigating the impact of duplicates during downsampling. It gathers wgs/target metrics and executes Picard Markduplicates (to remove duplicates) prior to downsampling. It allows downsampling to a specific depth or a desired downsample fraction. This workflow is compatible with both BAMs and CRAMs, and it also supports dragen aligned data. In the case of a CRAM input file, a reference dictionary needs to be provided.
