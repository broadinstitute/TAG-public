# GATK_CNV
Workflow for calling somatic copy number variants as tumor-normal or tumor-only mode. Supports both WGS and WES.

This WDL is originally from [CNV_Somatic_Panel_Workflow](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-somatic-cnvs) and 
is modified to output the number of segments, amplifications, and deletions in a Terra workspace table.
