# GATK_CNV
Workflow for calling somatic copy number variants as tumor-normal or tumor-only mode. Supports both WGS and WES.

This WDL is originally from [CNV_Somatic_Pair_Workflow](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/cnv_somatic_pair_workflow:4.2.0.0?tab=files) and 
is modified to output the number of segments, amplifications, and deletions in a Terra workspace table.
