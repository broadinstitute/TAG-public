The Blood Biopsy team developed ultra-low pass (ULP) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology and the analysis method, ichorCNA, that estimates tumor purity and ploidy of a sample. ichorCNA uses a probabilistic model, implemented as a hidden Markov model (HMM), to simultaneously segment the genome, predict large-scale copy number alterations (CNA), and estimate the tumor fraction of a ULP-WGS sample. ichorCNA can be used to inform the presence or absence of tumor-derived DNA and to guide the decision to perform whole exome or deeper whole genome sequencing. The details about ichor methodology and probabilistic model could be found in Adalsteinsson, Ha, Freeman, et al. Scalable whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA reveals high concordance with metastatic tumors. (2017) Nature Communications Nov 6;8(1):1324. The ichor script can be found in broadinstitute/ichorCNA. This workflow is designed for gene build hg19.
