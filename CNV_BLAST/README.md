# CNV BLAST Evaluation
## OVERVIEW
This WDL is designed to validate CNV (Copy Number Variation) calls
generated by the DRAGEN for a given genomic sample (HG002). The 
validation is performed by using a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) to search for the CNV sequence in both the HG002 T2T fasta file
and the reference genome (hg38).

## Output
This WDL generates two integer values representing the number of 
matches in the HG002 T2T reference and the hg38 reference. 
A match is defined as a BLAST hit where the alignment length is at 
least 95% of the query length and the percent identity of the 
alignment is at least 95%. These outputs allow for a direct comparison
of the representation of the CNV sequence in the two references.
